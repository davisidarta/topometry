Welcome to TopOMetry documentation!
=======================================================

TopOMetry (Topologically Optimized geoMetry) is a python package to learn high-dimensional data topology.
It allows learning similarity metrics and dimensional reductions. The dimensional reductions are
either new orthogonal bases encoding latent information or graph layouts for visualization.

It is particularly useful for the analysis of single-cell data, a high-dimensional data modality of paramount importance
in current biology.
