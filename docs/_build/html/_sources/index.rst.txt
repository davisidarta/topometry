Welcome to TopOMetry documentation!
=======================================================

TopOMetry (Topologically Optimized geoMetry) is a high-level python library to explore data topology.
It allows learning topological metrics, dimensionality reduced basis and graphs from data, as well
to visualize them with different layout optimization algorithms. The main objective is to achieve approximations of
the Laplace-Beltrami Operator, a natural way to describe
data geometry and its high-dimensional topology.
