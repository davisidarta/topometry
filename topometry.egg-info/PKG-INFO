        ## Topological metrics, basis, graphs and layouts
        
        TopOMetry is a high-level python library to explore data topology.
        It allows learning topological metrics, dimensionality reduced basis and graphs from data, as well
        to visualize them with different layout optimization algorithms. The main objective is to achieve approximations of 
        the [Laplace-Beltrami Operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%E2%80%93Beltrami_operator), a natural way to describe
        data geometry and its high-dimensional topology. 
        
        TopOMetry is designed to handle large-scale data matrices containing 
        extreme topological diversity, such as those 
        generated from [single-cell omics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_cell_sequencing), and can be used to perform topology-preserving 
        visualizations. 
        
        TopoMetry main class is the ``TopoGraph`` object. In a ``TopoGraph``, topological metrics are recovered with diffusion
        harmonics or Continuous-k-Nearest-Neighbors, and used to obtain topological basis (multiscale Diffusion Maps and/or 
        diffuse or continuous versions of Laplacian Eigenmaps). 
        
        On top of these basis, new graphs can be learned using k-nearest-neighbors
        graphs or additional topological operators. The learned metrics, basis and graphs are stored as different attributes of the
        ``TopoGraph`` object. 
        
        Finally, different visualizations of the learned topology can be optimized with ``pyMDE`` by solving a 
        [Minimum-Distortion Embedding](https://github.com/cvxgrp/pymde) problem. TopOMetry also implements an adapted, non-uniform
        version of the seminal [Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) 
        for graph layout optimization (we call it MAP for short). 
        
        Alternatively, you can use TopOMetry to add topological information to your favorite workflow
        by using its dimensionality reduced basis to compute k-nearest-neighbors instead of PCA.
        
        ## Installation and dependencies
        
        TopOMetry requires some pre-existing libraries to power its scalability and flexibility. TopOMetry is implemented in python and builds complex, high-level models 
        inherited from [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
        ``BaseEstimator``, making it flexible and easy to apply and/or combine with different workflows on virtually any domain.
        
        
        * [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - for general algorithms
        * [ANNOY](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) - for optimized neighbor index search
        * [nmslib](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) - for fast and accurate k-nearest-neighbors
        * [kneed](https://github.com/arvkevi/kneed) - for finding nice cuttofs
        * [pyMDE](https://github.com/cvxgrp/pymde) - for optimizing layouts
        
        Prior to installing TopOMetry, make sure you have [cmake](https://cmake.org/), [scikit-build](https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) available in your system. If using Linux:
        ```
        sudo apt-get install cmake
        pip3 install scikit-build setuptools
        ```
        We're also going to need NMSlib for really fast approximate nearest-neighborhood search across different distance metrics.
        If your CPU supports advanced instructions, we recommend you install nmslib separately for better performance:
        ```
        pip3 install --no-binary :all: nmslib
        ```
        Then, you can install TopOMetry and its other requirements with pip:
        ```
        pip3 install numpy pandas annoy scipy numba torch scikit-learn kneed pymde
        ```
        ```
        pip3 install topometry
        ```
        Alternatevely, clone this repo and build from source:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/davisidarta/topometry
        cd topometry
        pip3 install .
        ```
        ## Quick-start 
        
        From a large data matrix ``data`` (np.ndarray, pd.DataFrame or sp.csr_matrix), you can set up a ``TopoGraph`` with default parameters: 
        
        ```
        import topo.models as tp
           
        # Learn topological metrics and basis from data. The default is to use diffusion harmonics.
        tg = tp.TopOGraph()
        tg = tg.fit(data)
        ```
        Note: `topo.ml` is the high-level model module which contains the `TopOGraph` object.
        
        After learning a topological basis, we can access topological metrics and basis in the ``TopOGraph`` object, and build different
        topological graphs. 
        ```
        # Learn a topological graph. Again, the default is to use diffusion harmonics.
        tgraph = tg.transform(data) 
         ```
        Then, it is possible to optimize the topological graph layout. The first option is to do so with
        our adaptation of UMAP (MAP), which will minimize the cross-entropy between the topological basis
        and its graph:
        
        ```
        # Graph layout optimization MAP
        map_emb, aux = tp.MAP(tg.MSDiffMaps, tgraph)
        ```
        The second, albeit most interesting option is to use pyMDE to find a Minimum Distortion Embedding. TopOMetry implements some
        custom MDE problems within the TopOGraph model:
        
        ```
        # Set up MDE problem
        mde = tg.MDE(tgraph)
        mde_emb = mde.embed()
        ```
